# Web-Scraping-moed.gov
This is a little program that is for fun.
What does it do ?
It scraps the data for Syrian high school students in Syria using the Ministry Of Education Department (moed)'s website.
Nothing harmful was intended. It's just a program to test my web scraping skills.

# Notes
- added a new ninthGrade version for the new results that just came out.
- Make sure your system supports Arabic. 
- You may need a Proxy but I'm not sure.
- This script may not work after a certain amount of time. Since moed changes the site after the results are out for too long.
if you can get the new URL for the website, you can make it work by supplying it in the script.
- Please check if you can access the website BEFORE you run the script.
- You can convert Json files to CSV using the new script. Then you can view on Excel or Libre or whatever spreadsheet reader you have.
- the CSV script will be flipped if you try to view it in a text editor. Thats because Arabic is written from right to left. 
Don't worry. It makes no diffrance to computers.
