# Web-Scrapping-moed.gov
This is a little program that did for fun.
What does it do ?
It scraps the data for Syrian high school students in Syria using the Ministry Of Education Department (moed) website.
Nothing harmful was intended. It's just a program to test my web scrapping skills 

- Make sure your system have supports Arabic. 
- You may need a Proxy but I'm not sure.
- This script may not work after a certain amount of time. Since moed changes the site after the results are out for too long.
