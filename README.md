# Web-Scraping-moed.gov
This is a little program that did for fun.
What does it do ?
It scraps the data for Syrian high school students in Syria using the Ministry Of Education Department (moed) website.
Nothing harmful was intended. It's just a program to test my web scraping skills.

- added a new ninthGrade version for the new results that just came out.
- Make sure your system have supports Arabic. 
- You may need a Proxy but I'm not sure.
- This script may not work after a certain amount of time. Since moed changes the site after the results are out for too long.
- Please check if you can access the website BEFORE you run the script
- You can convert Json files to CSV using the new script. Then you can view on Excel or Libre or whatever spreadsheet reader you have.
- the CSV script will be flipped if you try to view it in a text editor. Thats because Arabic is written from right to left. Don't worry. It makes no diffrance to computers.
